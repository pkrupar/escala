## Escala

Escala is frontend framework designed for medium to large sized web applications following [this convention](https://gist.github.com/fat/a47b882eb5f84293c4ed) similar, but more pleasant to write, to [BEM](http://getbem.com/) and written in SASS. Escala is based on flexbox and dual styles - separated styles for mobile (small viewports) and for desktop (large viewports). This doesn't mean Escala is not responsive.
